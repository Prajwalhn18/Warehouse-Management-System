# Warehouse Management System

The warehouse management system(WMS) plays a very important role to reduce inventory costs. It not only reduces the cost but also helps to increase the ease of product delivery for a great customer experience.WMS definitely has a positive impact on the companies performance to compete at the global level. It shows the efficiency of a company to deliver the products ordered by a customer within a given time to the exact location. During this pandemic, we have noticed a high amount of traffic to e-commerce companies. What’s most important to any of these e-commerce companies is the warehouse with inventory. In order to manage these inventories within the warehouse, we need a good WMS. The main goal of WMS is to ensure the consistent availability of supplies for consumers.
